## Technical Implementation

### Backend Enhancements

#### Enhanced Notification Functions (Mongo.py)
```python
def create_attendance_notification(userid, message, priority="medium", attendance_type="general"):
    """Create attendance-related notification with specific types"""
    # Handles: clock_in, clock_out, auto_clock_out, missed_clock_out
    
async def notify_clock_in_success(userid, time, status="Present"):
    """Send notification for successful clock-in"""
    
async def notify_clock_out_success(userid, time, total_hours=""):
    """Send notification for successful clock-out"""
    
async def notify_auto_clock_out(userid, time):
    """Send notification for auto clock-out"""
    
async def notify_missed_clock_out(userid, date=None):
    """Send notification for missed clock-out"""
    
def check_missed_clock_outs():
    """Check for users who didn't clock out and send notifications"""
```
